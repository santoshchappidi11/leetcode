// 455. Assign Cookies
// Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies.
// But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

// Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with;
// and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i,and the child i
// will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

let g = [1, 2, 3];
let s = [1, 2];
// Output: 2

var findContentChildren = function (g, s) {
  g.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  s.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let maxContentChildren = 0;
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i <= s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] >= g[count]) {
      count++;
      maxContentChildren = count;
    }
  }

  return maxContentChildren;
